career is defined by your skills and how youve used them, not by any external measure of your progress . if your manager has to get involved in something you are responsible for, then by extension, she should be invested in your career . your manager can be a coach, but she cant be your personal coach if she doesnt see it as such . the more honest you can be with your manager about your aspirations, the faster youll move .

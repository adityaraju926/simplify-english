It’s not that I didn’t think about my career at all. Who needs career conversations when you’re busy changing the world?Here’s the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not. Maybe not. )Often, I hear people say things like, “I’m interested in advancing my career. What do I need to do to get promoted?”This is a perfectly valid question to ask, but I suspect what lurks beneath the question is the assumption that advancing one’s career = getting a promotion. In my opinion, it’s like equating being a good friend with getting invited to friend’s wedding.Certainly, the people who attend someone’s wedding are likely to be good friends. But you wouldn’t think that optimizing for getting an invitation to a wedding is the right way to go about being a good friend. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Would doing this teach you new skills and make you a more attractive hire for some other company down the line? Probably not. No matter where you journey, your skills and your past experiences go along for the ride. Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. When you do better, then by extension, she does better. Of course not. Discover the secret to life.Spoiler warning ahead, but this is what the secret to getting whatever you want turned out to be: if you believe it can happen, it will happen. (I know, I know. And these proof points give me confidence that all the new items I am still adding will also happen. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.Going back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want.

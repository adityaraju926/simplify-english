It’s not that I didn’t think about my career at all. Maybe not. If you focus 100% on being a great friend to someone, even if you never once thought about being invited to their wedding, guess what. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Probably not. Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. Of course not. Yes, of course, your manager still plays the role of judge. Yes, she can (and should) fire you if you can’t do the job, or do nothing but play Pokemon Go all day. (I know, I know. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.Going back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want.
